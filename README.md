# A relative value model for governance tokens

## Abstract

In blockchain networks, and more broadly in decentralized technology, tokens are often used to implement governance processes. So-called "governance tokens" are used to perform on-chain voting functions, allow or disallow protocol upgrades, and signal community sentiment around various network proposals. However, no coherent valuation framework for governance tokens has been described to date. In this work, we describe a relative value model for governance tokens based on a concept called "decisiveness" of a particular token holder's stake relative to a token distribution. The concept of decisive stakes allows us to impose an ordering on token stakes and therefore value one stake versus another, thereby paving the way for absolute valuation.
